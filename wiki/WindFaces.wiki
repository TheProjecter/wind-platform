= Introduction =

Wind Faces is the platform presentation module. The first implementation of it is based on [http://eclipsesource.com/en/eclipse/eclipse-rap/ Eclipse RAP]. However as it's coded following a commom interface, it's possible to have many other sorts of impl.
The user interface is builded at runtime by reading and interpreting domain objects strutcture.


= Details =

TODO, describe the commom faces interface and the basic path to code a new impl.
