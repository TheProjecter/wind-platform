= Listening to Model Changes =
To listen to app metadata changes a class must implement an interface from the wind-common bundle. Then register it using a service from the wind-app-registry. Whenever a change to the application metadata model occurs all listeners will got notified. Based on the type of the event recieved the listener will react in a proper way. 

The event types are divided in two levels. The first level defines where the change ocurred, it may be:

  * Application
  * Object
  * Property
  * Operation

The second level defines what have changed, it may be:
  * Item added
  * Item removed
  * Item property value changed

The listener also got a reference to the old and new values.
