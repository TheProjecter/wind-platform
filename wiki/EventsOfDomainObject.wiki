#summary Describes how events works at object level.

= Introduction =

While user is manipulating a Domain Object some events are generated. This events are captured by the Wind Platform and give  application bundle a chance to react to it.


= Events fired by Domain Object =

A Domain Object can trigger the following events during its manipulation:

  * Before Open
  * After Open
  * Before Close
  * After Close
  

To handle an event, user must specify a EventHandler at object level. The EventHandler get called when an event occurs and can do something in response.

== Configure EventHandler at Domain Object level =

The snippet bellow demonstrates how to nominate an EventHandler for a Domain Object.

{{{

domain_object preferences "Preferences" {

   event_handler: /br/com/maisha/preferences/handler/PreferencesEventHandler.py

...

}

}}}

An EventHandler can be written in Java, Groovy or Python as these are the languages supported by the platform. 

*Note*
--------
Once an EventHandler *does not* run in UI-Thread it can not do changes to the UI Widgets directly. To change a widget an EventHandler must change the meta (Domain Object).
